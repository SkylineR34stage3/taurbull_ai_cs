# Explanation: Define an asynchronous function using 'async def'.
# This function will eventually contain the logic to classify the query
# and decide which agent (Shopify, Content, etc.) to route to.
# It takes the user's query string as input.
# It's marked 'async' because the real implementation will involve
# async operations like calling an LLM.
async def route_query(user_query: str) -> str:
    """
    Placeholder for the Triage Orchestrator logic.
    Analyzes the user query and determines the appropriate agent.
